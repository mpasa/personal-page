This post is intended to explain the Functor abstraction with a simple increasing practical example. 


to gain intuition about what Functors are. After reading it, I hope you to understand the basic idea of a Functor and when to use it.

## Practical example
Let's image we manage tha access of database of users. The goal of our team is to provide a service to allow other teams to access that database. Our users look like:

```scala
case class User(id: Int, username: String, name: String, age: Int)
```

Our first version of the service look like:

```scala
trait UserService {
  def get(username: Int): User
}
```

After we've deployed the service, a colleague asks us what happens if the function is called with a username that doesn't exist. You answer that it throws a `NoSuchElementException` in that case.

In the following days, a lot of people commits very similar blocks of code like...

```scala
try {
  val user = userService.get(username)
  ...
} catch {
  case notFound: NoSuchElementException => ...
}
```

Some others forget to catch the exception and some projects crash in the middle of the night. Some angry people e-mail you, even if you added the documentation of the exception (after the first question was asked).

You think about it and decide to make it explicit that the function can return an empty value if the user doesn't exist. Scala has a type constructor for that, called `Option`. This optional type has 2 possible values, `None` and `Some(...)`. With this simple modification, you make sure that people have to check if the user exists before working with it.

```scala
trait UserService {
  def get(username: Int): Option[User]
}
```

In the following days, people start to replace the try-catch with something like:

```scala
val userOption: Option[User] = userService.get(username)
if (userOption.isDefined) {
  val user = userOption.get
  ...
else {
  ...
}
```

or

```scala
val userOption: Option[User] = userService.get(username)
userOption match {
  case Some(user) => ...
  case None => ...
}
```

You see that one of these commits is a function to get the user with its name capitalised:

```scala
def capitalise(username: String): Option[User] = {
  val userOption: Option[User] = userService.get(username)
  if (userOption.isDefined) {
    val user = userOption.get
    Some(user.copy(name = user.name.capitalize))
  } else {
    None
  }
}
```

You've introduced a specific **context** or **effect**, so you have to check if the value is available, extract it, transform it and finally build another time the context with the modified value.

This is exactly what a Functor does for us. It allows us to work with the inner type without knowing about the quirks of the specific context. We tell then that the code can be replaced with:

```scala
def capitalise(username: String): Option[User] = {
  val userOption: Option[User] = userService.get(username)
  userOption.map(user => user.copy(name = user.name.capitalize))
}
```

This piece of code works as expected:

1. It returns `None` if the user doesn't exists
2. It returns a `Some[User]` with the capitalised name if the user does exist.

If we check the implementation of `map`, we can see that is doing something very similar to what we did before:

```scala
sealed abstract class Option[+A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): Option[B] = {
    if (isEmpty) {
      None 
    } else {
      Some(f(this.get))
    }
  }
}
```

## The generic code
This function can be defined in a more generic way:

```scala
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
}
```

Here, `F` would be our `Option`. But in the end, what this is saying is: for a wrapped value (context) `F[A]`, apply a function `A => B` to get a wrapped transformed value. This function `f` doesn't have to know about the context, just about how to transform `A` into `B`.

## More example
Although Scala doesn't explicitly declare things to be Functors, a lot of type constructor are functors.

| Type constructor | Context                                                                           | What map does                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Option           | The result of the computation could not exist                                     | Apply the transformation to the element, if exists      |
| List             | The result of the computation could have produced an undefined number of elements | Apply the transformation to each result                 |
| Future           | The result of the computation could not be present now                            | Apply the transformation the result when it's available |

In Scala, if you want to work explicitly with the `Functor` definition, you should use a Functional Programming library like Cats or Scalaz.

### Conclusion
As you see, Functors try to abstract us from a context so we can focus on our domain. The result is the same functors, so map calls can be composed.
